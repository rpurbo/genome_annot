# ANI
# Here is the information for running the ANI which you mentioned you could add to your isolate pipeline. Prem sent me about how the latest batch of bacteria isolates were run with ANI. The code Prem passed to me:
#
# /gpfs0/scratch/cheinle/prems_ani/CalculateANIScores.sh 
#
# and
#
# /gpfs0/scratch/cheinle/prems_ani/SortRankANIresults.pl
